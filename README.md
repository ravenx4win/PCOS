  ## Introduction
  Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder affecting 5-10% of women in their childbearing years (15-45). It disrupts ovarian hormone balance, leading to elevated androgens or reduced estrogen. This imbalance causes fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries, obstructing ovulation and reducing fertility. PCOS increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, endometrial issues, sleep apnea, and mental health challenges. While genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development, early diagnosis, treatment, and weight management can help mitigate long-term complications.
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the detection and treatment of PCOS. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms analyze medical data, such as hormone levels, to identify patterns, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. AI systems also help monitor patients over time, offering valuable insights for tailored treatments and precise interventions. This technology enhances PCOS care, improving outcomes and efficiency for patients.
  ## Objectives
  (a) The proposed system aims to develop an advanced PCOS riskassessment tool using state of the art machine learning techniques and
modern healthcare practices.
(b)The primary goal is to enhance the accuracy, fairness, and user freindliness of PCOS prediction.

## Dataset
